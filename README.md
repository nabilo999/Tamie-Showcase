## 🌟 Overview  
**Tamie** is an Ai driven web app that helps create adaptable,clear,fast Schedules.  
Instead of manually setting up a calendar, simply answer a short survey and let the system auto-generate a personalized weekly schedule that can be further customized.  

Once your schedule is created, an integrated AI assistant helps you **tweak, rebalance, or optimize** it dynamically with natural language commands like:
> “I feel tired on Wednesdays — move my laundry day.”  
> “Find me time to write one page a day.”  
> “Shift my gym sessions to mornings instead.”

## ⚙️ Core Features  

### 📝 Smart Onboarding Survey  
- Answer simple questions about your **commitments**, **goals**, and **energy levels**.  
- Automatically generates a realistic, balanced weekly schedule.  
- Optional “invisible buffers” for meals and commutes keep things realistic without cluttering the view.

### 🤖 AI Chat Assistant  
- Ask the built-in chatbot to modify your schedule naturally.  
- LLM-powered reasoning ensures realistic rescheduling based on your habits, time constraints, and energy windows.  

Example:
```plaintext
User: I want to start writing a book.  
AI: I found a 30-minute window after dinner three days a week — want me to add it?
```

### 🔄 Dynamic Optimization  
- The system **learns from your real behavior** — what you skip, what you complete, and when you’re most productive.  
- Offers **smart suggestions** like:
  - “You tend to miss evening study sessions — move them to mornings?”
  - “You work best after 9 AM — shift deep work blocks later.”  
- Optional analytics and progress tracking show how your time use evolves.  
- Includes a **strictness slider** to toggle between flexible and fixed schedules.
